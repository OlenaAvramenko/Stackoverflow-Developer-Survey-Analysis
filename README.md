# Stackoverflow Developer Survey Analysis

This project is based on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and demonstrates how data can be cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Python, Pandas, and Tableau.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore developers’ preferences and working conditions using real-world data from Stack Overflow.  
The analysis covers work formats, compensation, programming languages, and database technologies.

### 🔍 Key Questions Answered:

- How many respondents participated in the survey?
- How many answered all the questions listed in the schema?
- What are the central tendency metrics for work experience?
- How many respondents work remotely?
- What percentage of developers use Python?
- How many learned programming via online courses?
- What is the average and median compensation of Python developers across countries?
- What are the education levels of the top 5 earners?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning and analysis (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Code development  
- **Tableau**: Final dashboard visualization  
- **Matplotlib / Counter**: Supporting visualizations in Python  

## 📈 Final Dashboard
